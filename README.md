# Microblogging Project

Welcome to our Microblogging Platform! This project provides a platform for users to engage in real-time conversations with others on the website. It serves as a space for users to chat and interact, much like Twitter's real-time messaging feature. The backend functionalities, including user authentication and database storage, are powered by Firebase, while the frontend is built using React.js. Below you'll find an overview of the features, technologies used, and how to set up and run the application.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: Frontend library for building user interfaces with reusable components.
- **Firebase Authentication**: Firebase authentication service for user authentication.
- **Firebase Realtime Database**: Cloud-hosted NoSQL database for storing and syncing data in real-time.
